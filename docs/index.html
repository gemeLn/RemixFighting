&#8195; Welcome to Remix Fighting, a game that takes inspiration from streetfighter. This game has three characters available and to view their
profiles click on the menu above. This game is made by three high school freshmen, who decided that making a game would be a great idea for
their computer literacy class.

<h2><center>Levels</center></h2>
At the moment there is only a single level, called the Ice House, in which players can battle. We plan to make new levels in the future if there is time. </p>
